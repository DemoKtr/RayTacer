# RayTracer

![RayTracer-PBR](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4855c78-4703-4203-af46-0c81ea937b3d)

A Vulkan-based ray tracer implementing physically-based rendering techniques.  
This project was developed for the course *Fotorealistyczna Grafika Komputerowa* (Photorealistic Computer Graphics) at Lodz University of Technology.

##  Features

- **Physically Based Rendering (PBR):** Simulates realistic material interactions with light.
- **Refraction and Reflection:** Handles transparent materials and reflective surfaces accurately.
- **Custom OBJ Importer:** Converts geometry into Vulkan acceleration structures for optimized ray tracing.
- **Realistic Lighting and Shadows:** Multiple light sources with correct shadowing.
